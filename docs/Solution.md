## 1. Problem Statement

### Background

Insyd Labs' B2B vertical serves AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) businesses. These businesses face significant challenges in managing offline payments, particularly:

- **Cheques** (especially Post-Dated Cheques/PDCs) - accounting for up to 50% of payment volumes
- **Cash payments** - popular for familiarity and unaccounted transactions

### Current Challenges

| Problem | Impact | Frequency |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Delayed payment cycles | Cash flow disruption | Daily |
| Bounced cheques | Revenue loss + bank charges | 3-5% of cheques |
| Manual bookkeeping errors | Financial discrepancies | Weekly |
| Poor PDC tracking | Missed collections | Monthly |
| Limited payment visibility | Poor planning | Continuous |

## 5. Key Algorithms

### 5.1 Statistics Calculation

**Total Outstanding**:
```javascript
Total = Sum of (amount) where status IN ('Pending', 'Post-Dated')
```

**Pending Cheques Count**:
```javascript
Count = Number of cheques where status IN ('Pending', 'Post-Dated')
```

**Cleared This Month**:
```javascript
ChequeCleared = Sum of (cheque.amount) where 
  status = 'Cleared' AND 
  MONTH(dueDate) = Current Month AND 
  YEAR(dueDate) = Current Year

CashCleared = Sum of (cash.amount) where 
  verified = true AND 
  MONTH(date) = Current Month AND 
  YEAR(date) = Current Year

Total = ChequeCleared + CashCleared
```

**Bounce Rate**:
```javascript
Bounced = Count where status = 'Bounced'
Processed = Count where status IN ('Cleared', 'Bounced')

Bounce Rate = (Bounced / Processed) × 100
If Processed = 0, then Bounce Rate = 0
```

### 5.2 Upcoming Payments Filter

```javascript
Algorithm:
1. Get today's date
2. Calculate date 30 days from now
3. Filter cheques where:
   - status IN ('Pending', 'Post-Dated')
   - dueDate >= today
   - dueDate <= 30 days from today
4. Sort by dueDate (ascending)
5. Take top 5 results
```

### 5.3 Recent Activity Aggregation

```javascript
Algorithm:
1. Get last 3 cheques (sorted by createdAt desc)
2. Get last 2 cash transactions (sorted by createdAt desc)
3. Combine into single array
4. Limit to 5 most recent
5. Format with appropriate type badges
```

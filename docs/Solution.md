{
  invoiceNumber: String (unique),
  clientId: ObjectId (ref: Client),
  amount: Number,
  issueDate: Date,
  dueDate: Date,
  status: ['Unpaid', 'Partially Paid', 'Paid', 'Overdue'],
  paidAmount: Number,
  remainingAmount: Number,
  description: String,
  items: Array,
  reconciledPayments: Array
}
```

#### B. Auto-Matching Algorithm

**Matching Criteria & Weights**:

| Criterion | Weight | Tolerance | Match Logic |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Client Match | 40% | Exact | clientId must match |
| Amount Match | 35% | ±2% | Within 2% variance |
| Date Match | 15% | ±7 days | Due date proximity |
| Name Similarity | 10% | 90% | Fuzzy string matching |

**Match Score Calculation**:
```javascript
matchScore = 0

if (payment.clientId === invoice.clientId) {
  matchScore += 40
}

if (Math.abs(payment.amount - invoice.remainingAmount) / invoice.remainingAmount <= 0.02) {
  matchScore += 35
}

if (Math.abs(paymentDate - invoiceDate) <= 7 days) {
  matchScore += 15
}

if (clientNames have 90%+ similarity) {
  matchScore += 10
}

// Auto-reconcile if matchScore >= 50
```

**Auto-Reconciliation Process**:
1. Fetch all unpaid/partially paid invoices
2. Fetch all cleared cheques and verified cash
3. For each payment:
   - Calculate match score with each invoice
   - If score ≥ 50: Auto-reconcile
   - Update invoice status
   - Add to reconciled payments array
4. Generate reconciliation report

**Output Report**:
```javascript
{
  matched: 15,
  unmatched: 3,
  matches: [
    {
      invoice: "INV-2024-001",
      payment: "CHQ123456",
      amount: 40000,
      matchScore: 85
    }
  ],
  unmatchedPayments: [
    {
      type: "Cheque",
      id: "CHQ789012",
      amount: 25000,
      client: "ABC Construction"
    }
  ]
}
